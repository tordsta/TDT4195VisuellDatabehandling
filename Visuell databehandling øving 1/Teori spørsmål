Task 2
A
1) It is called clipping
2) When the vertexes are outside the boarders of the viewport 
3) It is no point drawing graphics outside the viewport, as it is not seen. 

B
1) The triangle disepares 
2) The points are drawn in an other order. This is called face culling.
3) When you draw the points clockwise you end up (not) seen the backside. 

C
1) It resets each frame, so it makes sure it draws the "top layer" each time
2) When shadowing pixels, one for color and one for shaddow. (i think, idk) 
3) Vertex shader maipulates and controlls the "drawing" of vertexes. Fragment shader manipulates and controls all the stuff inbetween the vertexes, with pixels coloring and everyting. 
4) To easyliy be able to reuse vertexes, and genneraly easy to maipulate.
5) When the data you need in the buffer does not start at index 0. You change the number.
